# Foodie – User Stories

1. As a visitor, I want to register with username, email, and password so that I can save favorites and my own recipes.
2. As a user, I want to log in so that I can access my saved recipes and settings.
3. As a user, I want to browse a home feed with recipe categories so that I can quickly find meals by type.
4. As a user, I want a recipe detail screen with image, ingredients, instructions, prep time, servings, calories, and difficulty so I can cook it.
5. As a user, I want to favorite/unfavorite recipes so that I can find them later in a Favorites tab.
6. As a user, I want a “My Recipes” area to add, edit, and delete my own recipes so that I can manage personal content.
7. As a user, I want local persistence so my favorites and my recipes still show when the app restarts.
8. As a user, I want settings (theme, notifications toggle, language) so I can personalize the app.
9. As a user, I want push notifications for new recipes or reminders so I stay engaged.
